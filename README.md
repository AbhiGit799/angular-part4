# angular-routing-part4


Hi, <br/>

This is a simple Angular POC created by Abhishek Choubey. <br/>

In this POC I tried to demonstrate simple routing examples. <br/>

Here, I demonstrated the use of redirecting routes, [routerLink] , Child Routes, Nested Routes, Nesting Child Routes,  <br/>
Used Location service and ActivatedRoute service,

<b> Route Guards </b>
<br/>
Types of Route Guards used in this Angular POC. <br/>

- CanActivate <br/>
- CanActivateChild <br/>
- CanDeactivate <br/>
- Resolve <br/>

We can use the Angular CLI command <br/>
ng g g [guard name]  <br/>

Also I created local service  ng g s book i.e. book.service.ts <br/>
I defined book as data type i.e. class Book. <br/>
Here, <br/>
Books: Book[]  <br/> 
Books is an array of objects, and type is Book  <br/>

Software Used <br/>
node --version = v14.20.0 <br/>
npm --version = 6.14.17 <br/>
ng version <br/>
Angular CLI: 14.0.0 <br/>
